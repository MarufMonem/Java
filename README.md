*Contains basic implementations of nodes, stack, list, queue and priority queue*

#### Therap

*This contains the questions of therapBD given on December 10,2020 for, **Junior Software Developer position.** (you need to import reviewjava to run few of the solves )*

#### Dummy Headed Doubly Linked Circular List

*Contains 4 methods of a dummy headed circular list*
- Insert (inserts elements in the list)
- Remove (removes items)
- Print (prints the list)
- GetNode (give the element it would return the node)

#### Recursion
*A few practice problems from recursion*
